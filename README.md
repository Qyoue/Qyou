# Qyou

**Qyou** is an open-source, crowd-powered queuing intelligence platform that helps people avoid long lines at real-world locations like banks, hospitals, fuel stations, government offices, and service centers.

By allowing users to report and view real-time wait times, **Qyou** turns everyday queuing into shared public data. Built on **Stellar**, the platform adds a lightweight trust, rewards, and incentives layer—encouraging honest reporting and enabling new queue-based micro-economies.

## Why Qyou?

Queues waste time, energy, and productivity—especially in high-traffic public services. Yet queue information is usually invisible until you arrive.

Qyou makes wait times _visible before you commit_.

With Qyou, users can:

- Check real-time queue conditions before leaving home
- Decide the best time to visit a location
- Earn rewards for contributing accurate queue data
- Hire or become a **queue buddy**—someone who holds a spot in line on your behalf

By combining crowd-sourced data with blockchain-backed incentives, Qyou creates a system where truthful reporting is rewarded and time is treated as a valuable resource.

## Core Features

- **Real-Time Queue Reporting** – Users submit live wait-time updates at locations
- **Crowd Verification** – Multiple reports improve accuracy and confidence
- **Queue Discovery** – View nearby locations and their current wait times
- **Queue Buddies** – Hire trusted users to hold a spot in line for you
- **Stellar-Powered Rewards** – Earn tokens for verified reports and services
- **Reputation & Trust** – On-chain signals back honest contributors
- **Mobile-First Experience** – Designed for fast, on-the-go reporting

## Architecture Overview

Qyou is designed as a scalable monorepo with clear separation between user experience, core logic, and blockchain integration.

| Layer           | Technology                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Mobile App**  | React Native (Expo)                 |
| **Admin Web**   | Next.js (React)                     |
| **Backend API** | Node.js (Express Modular Monolith)  |
| **Database**    | MongoDB                             |
| **Blockchain**  | **Stellar**                         |
| **Payments**    | Stellar micro-payments & incentives |
| **Auth**        | Token-based auth                    |

## Monorepo Structure

The monorepo structure enables rapid iteration while keeping responsibilities isolated:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Running locally or via Atlas)
- **Stellar Testnet Account** (Optional for reading ledger)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install all dependencies from the root:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/qyoue/qyou.git](https://github.com/qyoue/qyou.git)
cd Qyou
npm install

```

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# API Config
API_PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/qyou

# Stellar Config
STELLAR_NETWORK=TESTNET

```

You can also copy the included templates:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Per-workspace templates are available at:
- `apps/api/.env.example`
- `apps/admin-web/.env.example`
- `apps/mobile/.env.example`
- `stellar/client/.env.example`

### 3. Run Locally (The "All-in-One" Command)

Start the Mobile App, Admin Web, and Backend API simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev

```

- **API:** [http://localhost:4000/health](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:4000/health)
- **Admin Web:** [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000)
- **Mobile:** Scan the QR code in the terminal with the Expo Go app.

### 4. Test Stellar Connection

To verify the Stellar blockchain integration is working:

```bash
cd stellar/client
npm run test-net

```

### 5. Seed Demo Data

For a demo-ready local database, seed sample users and locations from the API workspace:

```bash
npm run seed:demo --workspace=apps/api
```

This command:

- upserts demo admin and user accounts
- upserts a small set of representative locations
- writes `apps/api/scripts/output/demo-queue-activity.json` with synthetic queue activity fixtures for future queue-report ingestion

Default demo accounts:

- `admin@qyou.local` / `QyouAdmin123!`
- `demo-user-1@qyou.local` / `QyouUser123!`
- `demo-user-2@qyou.local` / `QyouUser123!`
